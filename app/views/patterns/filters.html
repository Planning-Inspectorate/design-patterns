    <!--<img src="/images/filter.png" alt="Filter">-->

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Use filters on the left first</h2>


    <p class="govuk-body">The Department for Education recommends you should place filters on the left of the screen.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">This allows the list of results to take up the middle and right-hand columns.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">This can make it easier for users to notice changes to the list of results as they select and apply filters.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">When to put filters at the top of the page</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">There are some cases where it is more suitable to use a filter on the top of the page.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">For example, when you need to show data in a table across the full width of a page or if related content in the right-hand column cannot be moved.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">Test each approach with your users and choose the one that works best for them.
    </p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">How to use this component</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">Allow users to expand and collapse individual filters in the vertical view.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">Add a “Show all filters” option to expand/collapse everything at once.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">Base filters on real user needs - make sure they are relevant and predictable to your users.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">Show applied filters as chips inside the filter panel.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">Indicate the number of items matching each filter where possible, updating dynamically as filters change.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">When filters have been applied, display the "Clear filters" option beside the "Apply filters" button.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">Make applied filters easy to remove from the panel.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">If there is a need to show or hide the filter panel (for example, to improve visibility of a map), include a clear ‘Show’ and ‘Hide’ button.</p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Filter list length</h3>

    <p class="govuk-body">Filter lists should be short, scannable and searchable. Show the most common options first. </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">If there are many filter options, consider grouping them into categories to help users find what they need more easily.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">If there are only a few filter options, consider using checkboxes directly on the page instead of a collapsible filter panel.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">Use a search box or collapsible list within the filter panel if there are more than 15 items (e.g., locations, names). 
    </p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Filters and search behaviour</h3>

    <p class="govuk-body">Filters and search must work together. Results should always reflect both.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">User selections should persist. If someone searches after applying filters, both the search
      term and the filters should remain until they are cleared.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">Provide clear ways to remove filters or clear the search independently.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">What not to do</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">Don't show long filters that scroll beyond the main page content, instead use expand/collapse. Avoid overwhelming users with long, ungrouped lists.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">Don’t create scroll traps - avoid endless scrolling in filter sections.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">Don't use unusual filter input types (e.g. radios for filters) unless there's a strong
      rationale.
    </p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Mobile design</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body"><a href="https://design.education.gov.uk/design-system/components/filter#:~:text=when%20using%20filters-,Mobile%20design,-When%20using%20mobile">See DfE guidance</a> for designing filters on mobile.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Accessiblity and consistency</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">Filters must be keyboard navigable and screen reader friendly (esp. expand/collapse, chips,
      show/hide).
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">Use simple, clean visuals (e.g., white backgrounds, uncluttered layouts, simple arrows).
    </p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Research on this component</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">User research findings on this component are in progress and will be added here when available.
